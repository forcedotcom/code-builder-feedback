# Welcome to the Salesforce Code Builder Beta!

Welcome to the next chapter in the Salesforce Developer Experience! Have you wanted to try some of our newer, modern tooling but didn't want the overhead of installing and configuring it locally? Would you like flexibility in how and where you work, from any computer? Do you want the power of a feature-rich development environment that's integrated with Salesforce? 

Step right up. Code Builder is here. This web-based integrated development environment provides the power and flexibility of Salesforce Extensions for VS Code and Salesforce CLI, including the new unified CLI, in your web browser -- the tools you want, optimized to do Salesforce work easily and productively. 

This repository is your place to give us feedback or report an issue. This is a public repository.  We request that you submit an 'Issue' if you are actively using Code Builder and have feedback or an issue.  If you just have a question or want to chat about Code Builder, head over to our [Trailblazer Commuity Group](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F94S000000kJcFSAU).


## We Want Your Feedback

We really appreciate your participation in the Code Builder beta. Your feedback will help shape the future of Code Builder as well as our other Developer tools. Please provide feedback often by creating [an issue](https://github.com/forcedotcom/try-code-builder-feedback/issues) in the repository. We are looking for general impressions and feedback on how this tool helps you in your current workflow, feature requests, and bugs. There are templates for each type of feedback. We look forward to hearing from you!

Feel free to be direct in your feedback but also remember that there are humans reading your comments, so please be respectful and adhere to our code of conduct. Also, provide feedback only in this repository or directly to the Code Builder development team.
