## Hello Code Builder

Welcome to the next chapter in the Salesforce Developer Experience! Have you wanted to try some of our newer, modern tooling but didn't want the overhead of installing and configuring it locally? Would you like flexibility in how and where you work, from any computer? Do you want the power of a feature-rich development environment that's integrated with Salesforce? 

Well say hello to Salesforce Code Builder! This web-based integrated development environment provides the power and flexibility of Salesforce Extensions for VS Code and Salesforce CLI, including the new unified CLI, in your web browser -- the tools you want, optimized to do Salesforce work easily and productively. 

This repository is your place to give us feedback or report an issue about Code Builder. This is a public repository.  We request that you submit an 'Issue' if you are actively using Code Builder and have feedback or an issue.
