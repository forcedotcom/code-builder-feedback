- :tada: :rocket: We’re excited to announce that Code Builder is now accessible in sandbox environments. Once an admin has accepted the Code Builder Terms and Conditions and assigned the necessary permissions, users can launch Code Builder directly from sandboxes.
This enhancement streamlines development workflows by enabling seamless access to Code Builder in non-production orgs - bridging the gap between sandbox and production environments and equipping developers with powerful, consistent tooling throughout the development lifecycle.
Get Ready! We’re rolling out this feature in waves—starting with 10% of orgs and expanding by an additional 20% each week until everyone has access. Keep an eye out—it’s coming your way soon!

## v1.3.0 (Sep 25, 2024) 

- We made a significant improvement in the startup time for Code Builder instances. The version number is still 1.3.0 because this is an infrastructure change rather than an update to the Code Builder package.

## v1.3.0 (May 3, 2024) 

- Removed the Environments tab, which represents object metadata. This change eliminates unnecessary user interaction with the object, reducing the risk of unintended changes that could break the environment.
